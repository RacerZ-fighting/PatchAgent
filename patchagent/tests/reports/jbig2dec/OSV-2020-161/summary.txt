The sanitizer detected a stack use after return vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A function accesses stack memory after returning, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. Here is the detail:

Address 0x7f3eb2774f08 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 8 in frame
    - jbig2_halftone_region /src/jbig2dec/jbig2_halftone.c:555:0

  This frame has 3 object(s):
    [32, 40) 'consumed_bytes.i.i' (line 273)
    [64, 96) 'rparams.i.i' (line 277)
    [128, 152) 'region_info' (line 557)
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork
      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Avoid returning addresses of local variables from functions, as stack memory is deallocated after return.
2. If persistent storage is needed, use heap-allocated memory instead of local stack memory.
3. Check the lifetime of variables to ensure they are not accessed after they go out of scope.
