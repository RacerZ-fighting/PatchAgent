The sanitizer detected a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A function writes more data to a local stack variable than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to execution hijacking. Here is the detail: 

WRITE of size 1 at 0x7f6a6f00871f thread T0
    - gf_m2ts_get_adaptation_field /root/src/media_tools/mpegts.c:2471:21

Address 0x7f6a6f00871f is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 287 in frame
    - gf_m2ts_get_adaptation_field /root/src/media_tools/mpegts.c:2350:0

  This frame has 2 object(s):
    [32, 287) 'URL' (line 2442) <== Memory access at offset 287 overflows this variable
    [352, 392) 'temi_loc' (line 2443)
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork
      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.
2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.
3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.
4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.
