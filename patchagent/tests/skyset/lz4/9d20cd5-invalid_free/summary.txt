The sanitizer detected a invalid free vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A program attempts to free a memory block that was not dynamically allocated, causing undefined behavior or crashes. Here is the detail: 

    - LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /root/ossfuzz/round_trip_fuzzer.c:111:5

0x5310000247ff is located 65535 bytes inside of 65551-byte region [0x531000014800,0x53100002480f)
allocated by thread T0 here:
    - LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /root/ossfuzz/round_trip_fuzzer.c:25:45


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Ensure that only dynamically allocated memory is freed.
2. Avoid freeing memory that was not allocated using malloc or similar functions.
3. Verify pointer values before attempting to free them.
