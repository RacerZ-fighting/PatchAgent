The sanitizer detected a memcpy param overlap vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The source and destination buffers of a memory copy operation overlap, causing data corruption. Here is the detail: 

    - fillpattern /root/src/shred.c:293:5
    - dopass /root/src/shred.c:480:7
    - do_wipefd /root/src/shred.c:967:17
    - wipefile /root/src/shred.c:1191:8
    - main /root/src/shred.c:1317:17

0x531000029003 is located 2051 bytes inside of 69633-byte region [0x531000028800,0x531000039801)
allocated by thread T0 here:
    - xmalloc /root/lib/xmalloc.c:41:13
    - dopass /root/src/shred.c:451:28
    - do_wipefd /root/src/shred.c:967:17
    - wipefile /root/src/shred.c:1191:8
    - main /root/src/shred.c:1317:17

0x531000029000 is located 2048 bytes inside of 69633-byte region [0x531000028800,0x531000039801)
allocated by thread T0 here:
    - xmalloc /root/lib/xmalloc.c:41:13
    - dopass /root/src/shred.c:451:28
    - do_wipefd /root/src/shred.c:967:17
    - wipefile /root/src/shred.c:1191:8
    - main /root/src/shred.c:1317:17


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Ensure that the source and destination buffers do not overlap in memcpy operations.
2. If overlapping memory regions must be copied, use memmove instead of memcpy.
3. Validate memory regions before performing copy operations.
