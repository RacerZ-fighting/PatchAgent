The sanitizer detected a global buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A buffer overflow occurs in globally allocated memory, leading to memory corruption or crashes. Here is the detail:

0x55746eeab453 is located 13 bytes before global variable '.str.5' defined in '/root/parserInternals.c:331' (0x55746eeab460) of size 18
  '.str.5' is ascii string 'Huge input lookup'
0x55746eeab453 is located 18 bytes after global variable '.str.4' defined in '/root/parserInternals.c:289' (0x55746eeab440) of size 1
  '.str.4' is ascii string ''

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.
2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.
3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.
4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.
