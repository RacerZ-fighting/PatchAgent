The sanitizer detected a floating point exception vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program encountered a floating-point exception, such as division by zero or invalid arithmetic operation. Here is the detail: 

    - cvtRaster /root/tools/rgb2ycbcr.c:257:19
    - tiffcvt /root/tools/rgb2ycbcr.c:352:11
    - main /root/tools/rgb2ycbcr.c:127:10


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Implement input validation to prevent division by zero and other arithmetic exceptions.
2. Use exception handling mechanisms to gracefully handle floating-point exceptions.
3. Check for invalid arithmetic operations that may lead to floating-point exceptions.
