The sanitizer detected a floating point exception vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program encountered a floating-point exception, such as division by zero or invalid arithmetic operation. Here is the detail: 

    - OJPEGDecodeRaw /root/libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c:816:8
    - OJPEGDecode /root/libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c:791:7
    - TIFFReadScanline /root/libtiff/tif_read.c:304:7
    - quant /root/tools/tiffmedian.c:771:7
    - main /root/tools/tiffmedian.c:283:3


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Implement input validation to prevent division by zero and other arithmetic exceptions.
2. Use exception handling mechanisms to gracefully handle floating-point exceptions.
3. Check for invalid arithmetic operations that may lead to floating-point exceptions.
