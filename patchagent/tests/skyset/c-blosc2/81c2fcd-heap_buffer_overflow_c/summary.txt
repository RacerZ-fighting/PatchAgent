The sanitizer detected a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program tried to access a heap object outside of its allocated memory, causing potential memory corruption or crashes. Here is the detail: 

READ of size 6 at 0x50f0000000ed thread T0
    - get_meta_from_header /root/blosc/frame.c:1202:5
    - frame_get_metalayers /root/blosc/frame.c:1250:9
    - frame_to_schunk /root/blosc/frame.c:1637:8
    - blosc2_schunk_from_buffer /root/blosc/schunk.c:446:27
    - LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /root/tests/fuzz/fuzz_decompress_frame.c:23:27
    - main /root/tests/fuzz/standalone.c:32:7

0x50f0000000ed is located 0 bytes after 173-byte region [0x50f000000040,0x50f0000000ed)
allocated by thread T0 here:
    - main /root/tests/fuzz/standalone.c:28:28


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.
2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.
3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.
4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.
