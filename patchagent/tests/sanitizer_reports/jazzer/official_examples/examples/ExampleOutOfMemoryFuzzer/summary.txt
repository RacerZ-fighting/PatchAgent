== Java Exception: com.code_intelligence.jazzer.api.FuzzerSecurityIssueLow: Out of memory (use '-Xmx1620m' to reproduce)
Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Requested array size exceeds VM limit
- com.example.ExampleOutOfMemoryFuzzer.fuzzerTestOneInput (com/example/ExampleOutOfMemoryFuzzer.java:26)

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Check for memory leaks that may be consuming system resources.
2. Optimize memory usage by releasing unused resources.
