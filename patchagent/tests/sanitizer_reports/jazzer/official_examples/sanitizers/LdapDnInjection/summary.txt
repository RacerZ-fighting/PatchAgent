The sanitizer detected a ldap injection vulnerability.The explanation of the vulnerability is: Untrusted input is used in LDAP queries, leading to potential injection attacks.Here is the detail: 

== Java Exception: com.code_intelligence.jazzer.api.FuzzerSecurityIssueCritical: LDAP Injection 
Distinguished Names based on untrusted data must be escaped as specified in RFC 2253.
- com.code_intelligence.jazzer.sanitizers.LdapInjection.searchLdapContext (com/code_intelligence/jazzer/sanitizers/LdapInjection.kt:120)
- com.example.LdapDnInjection.fuzzerTestOneInput (com/example/LdapDnInjection.java:32)

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Avoid constructing LDAP queries using untrusted input.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection attacks.
3. Sanitize user input before using it in LDAP queries.
