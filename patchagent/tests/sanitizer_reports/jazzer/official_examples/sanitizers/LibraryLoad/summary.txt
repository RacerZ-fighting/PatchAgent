The sanitizer detected a reflective call vulnerability.The explanation of the vulnerability is: An attacker can load and execute arbitrary libraries, leading to code execution vulnerabilities.Here is the detail: 

== Java Exception: com.code_intelligence.jazzer.api.FuzzerSecurityIssueHigh: load arbitrary library
- com.code_intelligence.jazzer.sanitizers.ReflectiveCall.loadLibraryHook (com/code_intelligence/jazzer/sanitizers/ReflectiveCall.kt:116)
- com.example.LibraryLoad.fuzzerTestOneInput (com/example/LibraryLoad.java:26)

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Avoid loading and executing arbitrary libraries in the application context.
2. Use secure APIs or sandboxed environments to execute external code.
3. Validate library paths and signatures before loading them into memory.
