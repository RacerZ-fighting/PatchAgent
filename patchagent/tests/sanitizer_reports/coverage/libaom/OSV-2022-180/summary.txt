The sanitizer detected a segv on unknown address vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program attempted to access an invalid or unallocated memory address, leading to a segmentation fault. Here is the detail: 

The signal is caused by a READ memory access.
    - fuzzer::FuzzerDriver(int*, char***, int (*)(unsigned char const*, unsigned long)) /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:0:0
    - main /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerMain.cpp:20:10


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Ensure all pointers are initialized before use to prevent null dereferences.
2. Validate pointer values before dereferencing them.
3. Implement default values for pointers to reduce the risk of unintended NULL dereferences.
