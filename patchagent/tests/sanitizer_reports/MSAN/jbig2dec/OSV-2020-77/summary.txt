The sanitizer detected a use of uninitialized memory vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program reads uninitialized memory, leading to undefined behavior or crashes. Here is the detail: 

    - jbig2_text_region /src/jbig2dec/jbig2_text.c:1030:9
    - jbig2_complete_page /src/jbig2dec/jbig2_page.c:215:20
    - LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /src/jbig2_fuzzer.cc:128:9
    - fuzzer::Fuzzer::ExecuteCallback(unsigned char const*, unsigned long) /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:614:13
    - fuzzer::RunOneTest(fuzzer::Fuzzer*, char const*, unsigned long) /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:327:6
    - fuzzer::FuzzerDriver(int*, char***, int (*)(unsigned char const*, unsigned long)) /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:862:9
    - main /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerMain.cpp:20:10

  Uninitialized value was created by an allocation of 'params' in the stack frame
    - jbig2_text_region /src/jbig2dec/jbig2_text.c:583:5


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Initialize all variables before using them to prevent uninitialized memory access.
2. Check for uninitialized pointers or memory buffers that may lead to undefined behavior.
