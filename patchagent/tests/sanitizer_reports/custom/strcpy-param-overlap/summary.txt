The sanitizer detected a function param overlap vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The source and destination buffers of a memory copy operation overlap, causing data corruption. Here is the detail: 

    - main /workspaces/PatchAgent/patchagent/tests/sanitizer_reports/custom/strcpy-param-overlap/test.c:10:5

Address 0x7fd6c6309023 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 35 in frame
    - main /workspaces/PatchAgent/patchagent/tests/sanitizer_reports/custom/strcpy-param-overlap/test.c:4:0

  This frame has 1 object(s):
    [32, 52) 'buffer' (line 5) <== Memory access at offset 35 is inside this variable
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork
      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)
Address 0x7fd6c6309025 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 37 in frame
    - main /workspaces/PatchAgent/patchagent/tests/sanitizer_reports/custom/strcpy-param-overlap/test.c:4:0

  This frame has 1 object(s):
    [32, 52) 'buffer' (line 5) <== Memory access at offset 37 is inside this variable
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork
      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Ensure that the source and destination buffers do not overlap in memcpy operations.
2. If overlapping memory regions must be copied, use memmove instead of memcpy.
3. Validate memory regions before performing copy operations.
