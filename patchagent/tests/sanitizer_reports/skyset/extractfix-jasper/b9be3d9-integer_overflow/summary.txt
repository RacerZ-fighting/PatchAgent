The sanitizer detected a undefined behavior vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program exhibits undefined behavior, leading to unpredictable results or crashes. Here is the detail: 

runtime error: signed integer overflow: 210 * -2147483646 cannot be represented in type 'int'
    - jpc_dec_process_siz /root/src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_dec.c:1234:33
    - jpc_dec_decode /root/src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_dec.c:391:10
    - jpc_decode /root/src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_dec.c:255:6
    - jp2_decode /root/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c:215:21
    - jas_image_decode /root/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c:395:16
    - main /root/src/appl/imginfo.c:203:16


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Review the code for undefined behavior patterns and correct them.
2. Check for type mismatches, signed integer overflows, and other undefined behavior triggers.
