The sanitizer detected a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: A function writes more data to a local stack variable than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to execution hijacking. Here is the detail: 

WRITE of size 8 at 0x7fed80700298 thread T0
    - get_sos /root/jdmarker.c:327:29
    - read_markers /root/jdmarker.c:1016:13
    - consume_markers /root/jdinput.c:386:9
    - jpeg_consume_input /root/jdapimin.c:301:15
    - jpeg_read_header /root/jdapimin.c:249:13
    - main /root/djpeg.c:542:10

Address 0x7fed80700298 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 664 in frame
    - main /root/djpeg.c:435:0

  This frame has 2 object(s):
    [32, 664) 'cinfo' (line 436) <== Memory access at offset 664 overflows this variable
    [800, 968) 'jerr' (line 437)
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork
      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)

To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. If overflow is unavoidable, allocate a sufficiently large buffer during initialization.
2. Add explicit bounds checking before accessing arrays or buffers to prevent overflows.
3. Replace unsafe functions like memcpy, strcpy, strcat, and sprintf with safer alternatives such as strncpy, strncat, and snprintf.
4. Check for integer overflows in size calculations that could cause improper memory allocations.
