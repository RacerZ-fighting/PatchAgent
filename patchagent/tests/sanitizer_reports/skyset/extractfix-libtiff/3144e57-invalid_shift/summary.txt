The sanitizer detected a undefined behavior vulnerability. The explanation of the vulnerability is: The program exhibits undefined behavior, leading to unpredictable results or crashes. Here is the detail: 

runtime error: shift exponent 136 is too large for 64-bit type 'long'
    - JPEGSetupEncode /root/libtiff/tif_jpeg.c:1646:19
    - TIFFWriteEncodedStrip /root/libtiff/tif_write.c:234:8
    - cpDecodedStrips /root/tools/tiffcp.c:997:8
    - tiffcp /root/tools/tiffcp.c:814:15
    - main /root/tools/tiffcp.c:303:9


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Review the code for undefined behavior patterns and correct them.
2. Check for type mismatches, signed integer overflows, and other undefined behavior triggers.
