The sanitizer detected a heap use after free vulnerability.The explanation of the vulnerability is: Memory is accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior and security risks..Here is the detail:

0x506000000031 is located 17 bytes inside of 56-byte region [0x506000000020,0x506000000058)
freed by thread T0 here:
    - free /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:52:3

previously allocated by thread T0 here:
    - malloc /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:68:3


To fix this issue, follow the advice below:

1. Set pointers to NULL immediately after freeing them to prevent accidental reuse.
2. Ensure that each allocated memory block is freed only once.
3. Track memory allocations and deallocations systematically to prevent use-after-free conditions.
4. Consider swap the order of freeing memory and accessing it.
